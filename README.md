# 4-CROsS-ROAD-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-CONTROLLER
4-cross road traffic signal controller is designed and implemented in Verilog. Moore Finite State Machine is used in designing the verilog project.

## Installation

This Verilog code is implemented in XILINX Vivado.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/eshav-23/4-CROSSS-ROAD-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-CONTROLLER>
    
    ```
    
2. Open XILINX Vivado and create a new project.
3. Add the Verilog source files from the cloned repository to your project.
4. Synthesize and implement the design.

## FEATURES
1.This 4-cross road traffic signal controller,Implements traffic light sequences for each road, ensuring safe and efficient flow of vehicles.
2.Integrates pedestrian signals and crossing timers to prioritize pedestrian safety.
